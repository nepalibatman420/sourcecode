                As the sun set on Earth, Alice made her final preparations. She had been planning this moment for months, and now it was finally time to put her plan into action. She couldn't believe she was actually doing it - stealing a prototype spaceship and leaving everything she knew behind. But she had to leave. There was no other choice.

                Alice made her way to the spaceport, heart racing with excitement and fear. She knew she had to be careful - if she was caught, it would mean the end of her dreams. She stayed in the shadows, moving quickly and silently. When she reached the spaceship, she took a deep breath and typed in the code she had memorized. The door hissed open, and Alice slipped inside.
                </p>
              
              
                <p>
                
                As the door closed behind her, Alice couldn't believe she had actually done it. She was in a spaceship, about to embark on a journey that would take her far away from everything she had ever known. She only hoped she was ready for what was to come. With a shaking hand, she powered up the engines and prepared to take off.
                
                As Alice sat at the controls of the prototype spaceship, she couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and nervousness. She had never stolen anything before, and the thought of being caught and punished was terrifying. But she had to leave Earth, no matter what the cost.
              </p>
              <p>
                
                "Come on, Alice," she muttered to herself. "You can do this. You've got this."
              </p>
            </div><div class="col-sm-4">
              <img class="  borderbutt" src="g11.png" alt="Image?"  id="img13" >
              </div><br>
            </div>
            <hr class="">

            <div  class="row">
              <div class="col " style="padding: 12px;">
                <p>
                She took a deep breath and activated the near light speed drive, feeling the ship shudder as it accelerated through the void of space. As the stars outside the window became streaks of light, Alice couldn't help but laugh with joy.
                <p>
                
                "This is amazing!" she exclaimed. "I can't believe I'm actually doing this!"
                </p>
                <p>                                   

                
                But Alice's joy was short-lived, as a voice crackled over the radio. It was the captain of the spaceship, and he was not pleased.
                </p><p>
                
                "Alice, I know you're out there. You have no idea what you're getting yourself into. Turn that ship around and come back to Earth before it's too late."
                </p><p>
                
                Alice frowned, her excitement turning to determination. She wasn't about to give up on her dream so easily.
                
                "I'm sorry, captain," she replied, her voice steady. "But I can't do that. I have to leave. I have to see what's out there, no matter the cost."
                </p><p>
                
                "Alice, you don't know what you're talking about," the captain said, his voice laced with frustration. "You have no idea what's waiting for you out there. Turn around now, before it's too late."
                </p><p>
                
                But Alice was determined. She had made her decision, and she was sticking to it. She flipped off the radio and set her course for the nearest wearable planet, leaving the captain's warnings behind. She was going to make her dream a reality, no matter what.
                </p>
              
                <p>
                As Alice navigated the prototype spaceship through the unknown regions of space, she couldn't help but feel a sense of awe and wonder at the vastness and beauty of the universe. She had always dreamed of exploring the stars, and now she had the opportunity to do so in a way she never could have imagined.
                
                
                As she journeyed on, Alice encountered strange and wonderful new worlds, each one more breathtaking than the last.
